# Project-1
First project for WDI SM 23

# What it is?
A game similar to Atari's Missile Command, but much simpler and unforutnately, not quite working 100%.

# Technologies/Frameworks Used:
1. SVG (scalable vector graphics) elements
2. jQuery animation
2. HTML, CSS, JS

# What works:
1. Missiles fall from the sky at a random rate
2. Collision detection

# Areas for improvement:
1. Collision detection does not work flawlessly
2. Missiles falling from the sky should fall at random angles, not just straight down
3. Add a counter for each players score

# Instructions:
1. Press the start button to begin
2. Try your best to shoot down each falling missile by clicking on the screen in the vicintity of each falling missile
3. You have unlimited ammo so click as much as you want. Not every click will explode a missile so don't be afraid the double/triple click on each falling missile
